<h1>Java API-Independent-Study</h1>
<p>Learning to make a game out of Java for the next 9 nine week, the first two week allow me to finish Codecademy lessons on the current Java course.</p>

<h3>Conditionals and Control Flow</h3>
<p>The second week of Independent Study and currently will be able to finish up the Codecademy lessons on Java by the end of Spring Break. First, I completed my review on "Conditionals and Control Flow"</p>

<p>For the second week before Spring Break, I began to learn Conditionals and Control Flow on Wednesday and completed the lessons by late evening Friday. I learned how to control the flow of a program with different values. </p>


<ol>

<li>Boolean Operators <b>&& / || / !</b> Precedence - Allows for boolean operators to be used coincide with other larger form of the expression. A summary of this below.</li>

<p>&& - Is an <b>and</b> operator returning true if both value are the same. Allow a set of code to be equal (below) to print out as true.</p> 

``System.out.println(true && true); // prints true``

<p> Another set of line with false to print (below) print out as false. </p>

``System.out.println(true && true); // print false``

<p>This line similar (below) to the second example will also print out as false.</p> 

``System.out.println(true && false) or (false && true); // print false``

<p>Expression used as (below) will print out as true. But it will be the opposite if not used correctly with <b>< or ></b>.</p>

``System.out.println(2 < 3 && 4 < 5);``

<p>|| - Is an <b>or</b> operator and returns the value as true if one other expression is the opposite is also 'true'. Allow a set of code to used "or" (below) to print out false.</p>

``System.out.println(false || false); // prints false``

<p>This lines of codes are opposite if using (below) to print out true.</p>

``System.out.println(false || true); // prints true / System.out.println(true || false); // prints true / System.out.println(true || true); // prints true``

<p>! - Is an <b>not</b> operator and returns the opposite expression by returning "true" as "false" and "false" as "true". Allow a set of code to used "not" within "System.out.println(!false); // prints true" to return as true.</p>

<p>This lines of codes is opposite if using "System.out.println(!true); // prints false" to return as false</p>

<p>Expression used (below) to print out as false. But it will be the opposite if not used correctly with "< or >".</p>

``System.out.println( !(4 <= 10) );``

<li>If-ElseIf-Else Statement - A summary of the if-elseif-else statements below.</li>

<p>If - If is a conditionals statements and is followed by a block of code with the expression as true and run forever. (Below) is an example of conditionals expression as it will return true for <b>Control flow rocks!</b> as printed in the console. If the line of code is not currently using <b>;</b>, it will use curly bracket <b>{}</b> to run the block of code as true.</p>

``if (9 > 2) {System.out.println("Control flow rocks!");}``

<p>If-Else - To activate a block of code, you can used <b>if/else</b> after <b>if</b> will return <b>true</b>. Anything else that is false equal to <b>if</b>, it will prints out the <b>else</b> statement (example below).</p>

``if (1 < 3 && 5 < 4) {System.out.println("I defy the Boolean laws!")} else {System.out.println("You can thank George Boole!");}``

<p>ElseIf -  If the statement is not true to the <b>if</b> statement, but it is equal to another statement, it should print out the <b>elsif</b> statement, but will print out <b>else</b> if non of the following statement is true (example below).</p>

``int shoeSize = 10; if (shoeSize > 12) { System.out.println("Sorry, your shoe size is currently not in stock.");} else if (shoeSize >= 6) {System.out.println("Your shoe size is in stock!");} else { System.out.println("Sorry, this store does not carry shoes smaller than a size 6.");}``

<li>Ternary Conditional - Both statements of <b>if / else</b> statements can be long when returning the value of the boolean. Ternary conditionals statements is a latin term for <b>composed of three parts</b> as:</li>

``1) A Boolean expression``
``2) A single statement that gets executed if the Boolean expression is true``
``3) A single statement that gets executed if the Boolean expression is false``

<p>More example can be shown (below). the <b>int</b> can be called to equal to the number 21 or greater than 20. Whatever value is can be printed in a console if the current state is true.</p>

``int pointsScored = 21; char gameResult = (pointsScored > 20) ? 'W' : 'L'; System.out.println(gameResult);``

<li>Switch Statement - A way to activate a code block is providing an equal block specific variable as the switch statement. It is organizable and can contain less word (below).</li>

``int restaurantRating = 3; switch (restaurantRating) { case 1: System.out.println("This restaurant is not my favorite."); break; case 2: System.out.println("This restaurant is good."); break; case 3: System.out.println("This restaurant is fantastic!"); break; default: System.out.println("I've never dined at this restaurant."); break; }``

<p><b>int</b>is used the variable <b>restaurantRating</b> as the value of 3, then can be printed on console by the variable values. If that variable number is equal between 1-3, it should return one of the following <b>case 1-3</b>, but if the number is not equal to the variable, then it should return the <b>default</b> statement.</p>

<li>Generalizations - The summary of the recent lessons on Conditionals and Control Flow:</li>

<p>Boolean Operator - <b>&& / || / !</b> are used to create a boolean expressions with a defined order.</p>

<p>Statements - <b>if / if/else / if/elseif/else</b> are used to activate the conditional blocks of code.</p>

<p>Ternary Conditional - Used shortened version of the variable <b>if/else</b> to return to value of the expression</p>

<p>Switch - Allow the user to check for equality in the variable/expression with the value that is not needed by boolean</p>
