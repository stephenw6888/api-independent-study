<p>For the second week before Spring Break, I began to learn Conditionals and Control Flow on Wednesday and completed the lessons by late evening Friday. I learned how to control the flow of a program with different values. </p>


<ol>

<li>Boolean Operators (&& / || / !) Precedence - Allows for boolean operators to be used coincide with other larger form of the expression</li>

<p>&& - Allow a set of code to be equal within "System.out.println(true && true); // prints true" to print out as true.</p> 

<p> Another set of line with false "System.out.println(true && true); // print false" to print out as false. </p>

<p>This line similar to rhe second example "System.out.println(true && false) or (false && true); // print false" will also print out as false.</p> 

<p>Expression used as "System.out.println(2 < 3 && 4 < 5);" will print out as true. But it will be the opporite if not used correctly with "< or >".</p>

<p>|| - Is an ``or`` operator and returns the value as true if one other expression is the opposite is also 'true'. Allow a set of code to used "or"  within "System.out.println(false || false); // prints false" to print out false.</p>

<p>This lines of codes is opposite if using "System.out.println(false || true); // prints true / System.out.println(true || false); // prints true / System.out.println(true || true); // prints true" to print out true.</p>

<p>! - Is a ``not`` operator and returns the opposite expression by returning "true" as "false" and "false" as "true".</p>

<li>If-ElseIf-Else Statement - </li>
<p></p>

<li>Ternary Conditional - </li>
<p></p>

<li>Switch Statement - </li>
<p></p>

<li>Generalizations - </li>
<p></p>
