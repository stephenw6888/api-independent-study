<h1>Java API-Independent-Study</h1>
<p>Learning to make a game out of Java for the next 9 nine week</p>

<h2>Before Reaching Java</h2>
<p>Before we started on Java, Leocadio and I was planning on choosing C++. Simeon made some disagreement around the Tuesday due to the difficulty. We researched on C++ and chnaged our current topic to Java. We plan to try to make a game with Java since it is multi-platform software for different type of code including: C to C++, Object-Oriented software, Java Runtime Environment.</p>

<h2>Current Information on Java</h2>
<p>Java allows for multi-purpose programming based on our recent studies on Ruby. Currently my partner, Leocadio Bonilla and Simeon Karakatsiotis are working on Java to make a workable game by the next nine week. We made plans to work on Codeacademy on Java for practice. ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java ) For the first week starting Thursady, we began our practice on Codeacademy on Java to understand how it function.</p>

<h2>What is on "Introduction To Java" Codeacademy</h2>
<p>Learning "Data Types" on the basic lessons of Java</p>

<l>int - Short for interger of positive and negatve numbers including zeros. Represent vumbers of visits of websites or programming language. This data type does not require quotes.</l>

<l>boolean - Is either true or false. Can be set iside "System.out.println(True/False);" to put our the current data as either true or false.</l>

<l>char - Represent single characters and includes the keyboard keys to produced text. Short for character and must be enclosed in quotes such 'G' or any other letters such as "System.out.println('G');". MUST BE SINGLE QUOTES!</l>

<l>Arithmetic Operators - +, -, *, /, %. </l>
<p>+ adds up numbers, - minus up numbers, * times up number, /  divide up number, % uses remainder as total.</p>

<l>Relational Operators - <, <=, >, >=. It compares data tpes in defining order. It is placed between two operands and compares with the result printed out "System.out.println(5 < 7);".</l>
<p>< less than, <= less than or equal to , > greater than, >= greater than or equal to.</p>

<l>Equality Operators - ==, !=. The operator does not require the operands to be shared as the same order. Can be tested for the boolean, char and int. Can be used with mychar, myInt, and withing (myChar == myInt) as well.</l>
<p>== equal to, != not equal to</p>

<l>Varibles - are used to store values as variable and in Java used specific data type. Such example is int myLuckyNumber = 7; and the semicolon ends all Java single code statements. Other statements does not required semicolons.</l>

<l>Whitespace -  Is one or more characters such as (spaces, tabs, enters, or returns) that does not have visibles marks. It is used to make codes staements visibles and readable. Java ignores whitespaces and is easier to read.</l>

<l>Comments - Allows for intext that does not interfere with the program and is ignored. Help allow the code to be readable by everyone and is used in "// text" in the begin single line codes or "/* text */" for mulit-line codes</l>

<p>I still need to complete the 75 percent of the study guide on Java.</p>

<h2>What Takeaway?</h2>
<p>I have learn a few thing on Java and understand how it work. boolean is used to show a true or false statements as based the software program. int allows for a number to be shown and printed out on the System output. The char to also input the letter as represented on the line of codes or sentences. Using variables after the three data type after "boolean isComplete = true;", "int awesomeLevel = 121;", "int epicLevel = awesomeLevel * 2;", "System.out.println(epicLevel)" to be printed out. </p>
<p>This all I have to learn and will study on the next 75 percent of Java for the second week.</p>
