<h1>Java API-Independent-Study</h1>

<h2>Before Reaching Java</h2>
<p>Before we started on Java, Leocadio and I was planning on choosing C++. Simeon made some disagreement around the Tuesday due to the difficulty. We researched on C++ and chnaged our current topic to Java. We plan to try to make a game with Java since it is multi-platform software for different type of code including: C to C++, Object-Oriented software, Java Runtime Environment.</p>
<h2>Current Information on Java</h2>
<p>Java allows for multi-purpose programming based on our recent studies on Ruby. Currently my partner, Leocadio Bonilla and Simeon Karakatsiotis are working on Java to make a workable game by the next nine week. We made plans to work on Codeacademy on Java for practice. ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java ) For the first week starting Thursady, we began our practice on Codeacademy on Java to understand how it function.</p>
