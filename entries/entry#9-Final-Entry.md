<li>Presentation - SEP EXPO/Slides</li>

<p>Early morning Friday, my partners, Simeon, Leocadio, and I presented our Java project to the audience of the SEP showcase. Learning how to appropriately speak to an audience while cooperating with your partners throughout multiple slides was a bit difficult. The set back made by me was skipping the future plans for our Java project as I forgot and went to the end of the slides.</p>

<p>Slides-Details: The details used in the slides was mixed with some background image, a hook, a video, and the code. The task was separated through different role for the presentation. The plan was to hook the audience in, then explain a bit of the process of where we are. The video would then be shown where my partners explain the video. Finally, a few explanations about our codes and the process through mistakes and steps.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>This independent project is a large task that took a while to finish. The idea to make a game comes from our own inspiration from wanting to make and play games. The learning process for the Java course was a bit intense and still new to me, but my partners were able to make it a lot easier with practice and persistence. The slideshow made was put together with the knowledge and idea that was going to be shown at the expo. The presentation practice was a great foresight from other students who had given us tips and advice for our slides. The actual showcase was a hit and we made a great effort to presenting our game well. The independent study given by our teacher was a great opportunity to learn from different codes and to be able to adapt, learn, and respect for the software development industry.</p>

<h2>Takeaway</h2>

<li>A lot of things can go wrong can possibly go wrong. Learn from some of your mistakes and you can build something great. For presentation, practice make the purpose, I made a lot of mistakes and I clearly needed more practice, something at least that I can be able to learn from.</li>

<li>If you want to make a project a success, make sure to hook your audience in with something that shows intrigues over your project.</li>
