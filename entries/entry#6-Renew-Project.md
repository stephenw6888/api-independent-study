<p>My partners and I had some majors difficulties during our research on the video we are learning from.

<li>If you have no idea of what to do to make an MVP. You must change your research material so you can have a more wide variety of information and example..</li>

<li>Make sure to get something done to have a basic example that can be shown to anyone.</li>

<li>Google is your bestfriend, if you are confused or understanding something, search it.</li>

<li>If working with a partner or someone else is working on the same topic, ask for help if you need a plan or idea.</li>
