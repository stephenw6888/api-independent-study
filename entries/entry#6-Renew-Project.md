<h1>Java Independent-Study</h1>

<h2>Watching a YouTuber by the name of "ForeignGuyMike" for examples on a side-scroller game.</h2>

<p>My partners and I had some majors difficulties during our research on the video we are learning from. Since we planned to make a side-scroller game, we were unable to get a basic idea of how to get our code to work. I accidentally stumbled on a video called Dragon Tale Java game and we found an example for us to use as a replacement for our video research.</p>

<li>What is Going On?</li>

<p>Summary: My partners and I created five files, Audio, Entity, GameState, Main, TileMap.</p>

<ol>

<li>Audio: Audio file for game</li>

<p>This files contains different audio based on every clip that is played. The function of the audio is to synchronized game audio with what the player hear and see.</p>

<li>Entity: Objects and Animation file for game</li>

<p>Entity contains all different files such as animation to the enemy and the player. Adding on, it would contain animation based on different character and map objects. Including a HUD and enemies entities code.</p>

<li>GameState: Level status to game functionalit.y</li>

<p>Game State used the player control to the entity of the object being controlled. Adding on, keyboard function is used and both objects, maps, and sprites are used within the game.</p>

<li>Main: Game main connection to key control and basic function.</li>

<p>Main basically allows the game to run. It allows for the game to have a default setting and scaling the window screen to its keyboard function.</p>

<li>TileMap: Map tiles and background with the game function.</li>

<p>Tile Map contains map file. The map file used is in sync with the objects that are on the screen.</p>

</ol>


<h2>Takeaway</h2>

<li>If you have no idea of what to do to make an MVP. You must change your research material so you can have a more wide variety of information and example..</li>

<li>Make sure to get something done to have a basic example that can be shown to anyone.</li>

<li>Google is your best friend, if you are confused or understanding something, search it.</li>

<li>If working with a partner or someone else is working on the same topic, ask for help if you need a plan or idea.</li>
