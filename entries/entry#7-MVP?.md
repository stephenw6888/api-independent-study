<h1>Java Independent-Study</h1>

<h2>Watching a YouTuber by the name of "ForeignGuyMike" for examples on a side-scroller game.</h2>

<p>My partners and I had some majors difficulties during our research on the video we are learning from. Since we planned to make a side-scroller game, we were unable to get a basic idea of how to get our code to work. I accidentally stumbled on a video called Dragon Tale Java game and we found an example for us to use as a replacement for our video research.</p>


<li>Almost an MVP?</li>

<p>Summary: My partners and I was able to provide an MVP with the time spent this weekend.</p>


<ol>

<li>Audio: Audio file for game</li>

<p>Tile Map contains map file. The map file used is in sync with the objects that are on the screen.</p>

</ol>


<h2>Takeaway</h2>

<li>If you have no idea of what to do to make an MVP. You must change your research material so you can have a more wide variety of information and example.</li>

<li>Make sure to get something done to have a basic example that can be shown to anyone.</li>

<li>Google is your best friend, if you are confused or understanding something, search it.</li>

<li>If working with a partner or someone else is working on the same topic, ask for help if you need a plan or idea.</li>
